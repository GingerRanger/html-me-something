        <h1>Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief</h1>
        <p>Never before had I been as enthralled in mythology as i was while reading this book. This high-adventure series start imagines Greek mythology in the modern world through the eyes of a sardonically funny 12-year-old who many kids know and love. Percy Jackson's origin story and first quest as a hero combine in The Lightning Thief. He goes from the worst kid in a school for delinquents with the worst -- and smelliest -- stepdad ever to full-fledged hero in less than 400 pages!</p>

        <h1>Parallel</h1>
        <p>Down the virtual reality MMORPG rabbit hole we go. Following the death of his popular online persona, seventeen-year-old Suzuki Mato decides it’s time to retire from professional VR gaming. However, his plans are abruptly cut short when he’s kidnapped from his high school and forced to be a guinea pig for Genaco Gaming, the world’s largest esports and entertainment company. Armed with nothing but his wit and a new online persona, he’s thrown headfirst into the virtual reality of “Live No Evil,” a VRMMORPG littered with overpowered bosses, secretive NPCs, and backstabbing gods. His mission? Find a way to conquer this new world and get back at the company that took over his life, all while avoiding ‘Parallel’ — a condition that would make it impossible to separate his real and virtual personalities. Because in a world obsessed with VR gaming, Parallel means death, and Suzuki just doesn’t have time for that… </p>
